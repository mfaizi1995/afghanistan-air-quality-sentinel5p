    "\n",
    "This report analyzes six years of satellite-based air quality data over major Afghan cities using the Sentinel-5P TROPOMI sensor. We focus on two key atmospheric pollutants:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NO₂ (nitrogen dioxide)** – traffic, generators, heating\n",
    "- **CO (carbon monoxide)** – incomplete combustion, trash burning, cooking/heating fires\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute monthly averages, multi-year trends, seasonal cycles, pollutant correlations, and city-to-city differences. The analysis highlights strong winter pollution peaks, clear seasonal cycles, and meaningful differences between cities.\n",
